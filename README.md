# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
This is my final year project made for my degree at the University of Bradford
The main project aims were to research and create a protoytpe for speech emotion recognition.
There therefore three pythong jupyter files here, predictions, SpeechSignalEmotion and TextEmotion.

### Predictions.ipynb
This file contains the culmination of my work. 3 trained models working together in a single software with GUI where the user can test any audio file they like for a prediction from the software.

### SpeechSignalEmotion.ipynb
This file contains the code used to create both the default speech emotion model as well as the alternative gendered emotion model

### TextEmotion.ipynb
This file contains the code used to create the text model based on strings of words

# HOW TO RUN
To run this project, download the files from this repository and you will also need another file which is the saved TextEmotion model. The model was too large so I uploaded it to Google Drive instead.

Download the file using the link above and place it directly into the '/Models' directory.
Next all that is needed to do is run the code in Predictions.ipynb and the GUI will display given that all necessary libraries have been installed.
