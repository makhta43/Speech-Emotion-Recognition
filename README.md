This is my final year project made for my degree at the University of Bradford
The main project aims were to research and create a protoytpe for speech emotion recognition.
There therefore three python jupyter files here, predictions, SpeechSignalEmotion and TextEmotion.

### Predictions.ipynb
This file contains the culmination of my work. 3 trained models working together in a single software with GUI where the user can test any audio file they like for a prediction from the software.

### SpeechSignalEmotion.ipynb
This file contains the code used to create both the default speech emotion model as well as the alternative gendered emotion model

### TextEmotion.ipynb
This file contains the code used to create the text model based on strings of words

# HOW TO RUN
To run this project, download the files from this repository and then download the file using the link below and place it directly into the '/Models' directory.

Run the code in Predictions.ipynb and the GUI will display given that all necessary libraries have been installed.

## Datasets
Three datasets were used that are not included in this repository. They are the following: \
RAVDESS - https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/ \
SAVEE - http://kahlan.eps.surrey.ac.uk/savee/ \
TESS - https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487 \
If you would like to run the SpeechSignalEmotion.ipynb, you will need to gain access to these datasets and put them into the /Datasets directory using the format currently visible.
